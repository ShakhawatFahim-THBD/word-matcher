    Whole text file to a String in Java

I am trying to read the contents of a file using FileReader . But i want to read the file without reading a line by line . Is it possible to read the whole file without loop. I am using the following code

 try
 {
     File ff=new File("abc.txt");
     FileReader fr=new FileReader(ff);

     String s;
     while(br.read()!=-1)
     {
          s=br.readLine();
     }
 }

 catch(Exception ex)
 {
     ex.printStackTrace();
 }

If the file is small, you can read the whole data once:

File file = new File("a.txt");
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
byte[] data = new byte[(int) file.length()];
fis.read(data);
fis.close();

String str = new String(data, "UTF-8");

Java 7 one line solution

List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("file"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

or

 String text = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("file")), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

Android uses Java 6 ... The solution above uses API of Java 7 ... –  sockeqwe Jun 13 '14 at 22:42

Not all Java answers have to be suited to Android, @akauppi! Just look for a solution that Android supports from another answer! –  Isaac Woods Apr 4 at 13:54

You can try using Scanner if you are using JDK5 or higher.

Scanner scan = new Scanner(file);
scan.useDelimiter("\\Z");
String content = scan.next();

Or you can also use Guava

String data = Files.toString(new File("path.txt"), Charsets.UTF8);

Note that the scanner should be closed after use. –  Barry NL Feb 13 at 11:27


String data = Files.toString(new File("path.txt"), Charsets.UTF_8);. Just a small typo. :-) –  pisaruk Jun 12 at 18:33

If you are using Java 5/6, you can use Apache Commons IO for read file to string. The class org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils contais several method for read files.

e.g. using the method FileUtils#readFileToString:

File file = new File("abc.txt");
String content = FileUtils.readFileToString(file);
